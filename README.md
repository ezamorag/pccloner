# pccloner
When you execute a task on your PC, it captures mouse and keyboard actions, including the cursor's position and a preceding screenshot. You can then replay the captured task whenever desired.
 
Supported Features:
* Capable of replaying double clicks and drag motions.
* Designed to replay almost all keystrokes (please report any unsupported keys).
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 11.
* It records and replays the cursor's trajectory before each keyboard and mouse event.

**Conditions for Optimal Performance**: The stored task must be replayed on the same computer, and the screen's initial state during replay should closely resemble the initial state when the task was recorded.

Known Issues:
* On Ubuntu 20.04: 
    1) Occasionally, the collector registers one extra scroll action than required, which does not accurately replicate the task.
    2) During replay, attempting to type over "Show Applications" does not work; the input is sent to the terminal instead.
    3) If you use a hidden taskbar, the replayer cannot activate it, even if this action was recorded. 
* On Windows 11:
    1) Scrolling isn't detected when using a touchpad; please use a mouse instead.
    2) The function (fn) key is detected but not recognized.
    3) The alt_gr key can generate sequences of pairs (alt_gr + ctrl_l), leading to the unnecessary storage of screenshots.
* General issues:
    1) Sometimes, when minimizing a window, the size and location of the window differ from the original stored task, which could cause the replayer to fail.

## Installation
```bash
pip install pccloner
```
On ubuntu: it requires to install gnome-screenshot.
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-screenshot
```

## Basic usage
1. Download and run the file ```python testing.py``` in your environment where pcpcloner is installed. 
2. Press the ESC key to start recording. Remember to press the ESC key again to stop the recording. The program will create a folder called 'data' where all task-related data will be saved. 
3. If you want to replay the task, type 'yes' when prompted with 'Do you want to replay the previous task? and press enter. 


## Advanced usage
1. Write a python script with following lines:
```bash
File: collector.py

from pccloner.pcdata import Collector

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pc = Collector()
    data_df = pc.start()
```
2. Run the previous script ```python collector.py```
3. Press the ESC key to start recording. And don't forget to press again the ESC key to terminate the recording. This code will create a folder called "data" where it will save all the data related to your task.
4. Use the next code to replay your previous stored task ```python replayer.py -p [YOUR_PATH_TO_CSV_FILE]```. At replaying, you can exit the process pressing ESC. 
```bash
File: replayer.py

from glob import glob 
from pccloner.pctask_pr import Replayer
import pandas as pd
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-p', '--csvpath', help="path to the task data")
parser.add_argument('--viz', action=argparse.BooleanOptionalAction, default=False, help="To visualize actions")
parser.add_argument('--screen', action=argparse.BooleanOptionalAction, help="True means that it uses the current screenshots to visualize actions")
parser.add_argument('--mousemoves', action=argparse.BooleanOptionalAction, help="True means that cursor movements before each event is performed (except to drags events)")

args = parser.parse_args()

if not args.csvpath:
   print(glob('data/*/raw_pcdata.csv'))
   print('Select your stored task using the argument -p to give the path')
else: 
   sample = pd.read_csv(args.csvpath)
   task1 = Replayer(sample, data_dir='./')
   task1.execute(viz=args.viz, screen_flag=args.screen, mousemoves_flag=args.mousemoves)
```
