# pccloner
 When you perform a task on your PC, it stores mouse and keyboard actions along with the concurrent cursor position (and preceding screenshot) and then you can replay the stored task when you want. 

 Current limitations: 
 * No drag actions 
 * Not pressed two keys o more at the same time
 * The replayer is not prepared for all events
 * It has been tested only on Ubuntu 20.04.
 * The initial screen state at replaying must be similar to the stored initial screen state. 
 * Your replayed task performs well on the same computer with similar conditions.
